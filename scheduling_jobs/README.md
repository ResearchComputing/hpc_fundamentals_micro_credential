# Scheduling Basic Jobs

In this training we will cover the basics of submitting jobs to our High Performance 
Computer (HPC) system named Alpine. We will first provide a general overview of job 
scheduling, why submitting a job is necessary, and what types of jobs there are. 
Once sufficient information has been obtained, we will then proceed to discuss submitting 
a batch job. Lastly, we will provide an example of submitting and working with an interactive job.
