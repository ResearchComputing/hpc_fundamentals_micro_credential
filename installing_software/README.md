# Finding, downloading, and applying software on CURC

Installing software on shared HPC resources is one of the most significant 
challenges when porting workflows from desktop computers. In addition to 
providing common compilers for manual builds, CURC supports a variety of tools 
for installing software on our systems, including Anaconda, Spack, and Apptainer. 
Learning how to leverage these tools can save users time and effort in the long 
run but require an up-front investment. In this talk, we will cover the module 
system and then provide a brief overview of each installation method. Participants 
can gain hands-on experience building research applications by completing the 
provided exercises. Note that the exercises provided in this directory are not 
necessary to complete for the micro-credential.
